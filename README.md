# Bairava

A 2D pixel-art game engine in progress, written in Zig. It draws a tile map at a fixed native resolution, scales it to any window size with nearest-neighbor filtering, and lets a player walk around while a camera follows and zooms. Rendering goes through SDL3's GPU API, with shaders written in Slang and compiled to SPIR-V, and optionally to DXIL for Direct3D 12 or MSL for Metal.

⚠️ The engine is not stable for production use (yet).

The package is named `Bairava` in `build.zig.zon`, the executable is `Semkootru`, and the window title is `Semkootru`.

**Status:** early prototype. The rendering path works end to end, and one animated character walks a tile map while the camera follows. Gameplay systems such as entities, collision, and audio have not been started. Text and basic UI widgets have a first version that hasn't been checked in the running game yet.

## Requirements

- **Zig** at the version named by `minimum_zig_version` in `build.zig.zon`, currently `0.16.0-dev.3142+5ccfeb926`.
- **slangc**, the Slang shader compiler, on your `PATH`. Building the optional DXIL shaders (`-Ddxil=true`) also needs a `slangc` that can emit DXIL.
- **For Metal:** build with `-Dmetal=true`; `slangc` must support its Metal target.
- **A GPU backend supported by SDL3.** The default build provides SPIR-V and requests Vulkan 1.2. `-Ddxil=true` adds DXIL for Direct3D 12, and `-Dmetal=true` adds MSL for Metal.
- **Internet access for the first build**, so Zig can fetch SDL3. Later builds work offline.
- **cglm 0.9.7** is vendored under `vendor/cglm/`, including the C sources and headers used by the build.
- **`vendor/stb_rect_pack.h`, `vendor/stb_image_write.h`, and `vendor/stb_truetype.h`**. The build uses the first two to pack the texture atlas and `stb_truetype.h` to preprocess fonts. All three are single-file libraries from [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb). Fetch them once before the first build: `curl -L -o vendor/stb_rect_pack.h https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothings/stb/master/stb_rect_pack.h`, and the same for `stb_image_write.h` and `stb_truetype.h`.
- **Optional:** the cross-platform checkerboard keyer can be built through Zig; see [Asset keyer](#asset-keyer).
- **Optional:** the Tracy profiler, version 0.14.1, to view profiling zones with `-Dtracy=true`. Get it from [wolfpld/tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/tag/v0.14.1). The game's Tracy client is built from source by `build.zig`, through ztracy, so only the viewer is separate. See Debugging.

## Building and running

Run commands from the project root. The build installs `assets/` beside the executable in `zig-out/bin/assets/`, and shaders are embedded in the executable, so the game runs from any directory.

```
zig build                          # compile the executable and shaders into zig-out/
zig build run                      # build and launch the game
zig build run -Dgpu-debug=true     # launch with SDL GPU validation enabled
zig build run -Dtracy=true         # launch with Tracy profiling zones, for a Tracy profiler that is already running
zig build -Ddxil=true              # also compile DXIL shaders for Direct3D 12
zig build run -Dmetal=true         # also compile MSL shaders and allow SDL to select Metal
zig build test                     # run unit tests (no GPU or window; links SDL and needs slangc)
```

`zig build` installs `zig-out/bin/Semkootru(.exe)`. The compiled shaders are embedded in that executable, so `zig-out/shaders/` is no longer written. The build validates and stages runtime files from `assets/asset_manifest.txt` under `zig-out/bin/assets/`, including a generated `asset-index.txt`. Each manifest row declares a name, kind, source, runtime path, and named dependencies. Image, WAV, and TrueType/OpenType inputs are format-checked; maps and generic files are checked for existence. Image entries emit BC1, BC3, and RGBA8 GPU texture variants alongside the source image; when `astcenc` is installed and available on `PATH`, the builder also emits ASTC 4x4. The sprite atlas is packed from `assets/sprites.txt` and sent through the same texture processor, with its regions written to `atlas.txt`. At runtime, SDL's format support query picks ASTC, BC3, or BC1 when the active device can sample that format; otherwise the prebuilt RGBA8 variant or decoded source image is used. Audio entries are copied as WAV and encoded to compact IMA ADPCM sidecars; `wav` entries are copied uncompressed. Font entries generate `.bfnt` files containing an alpha-only glyph atlas, baked metrics, and the codepoint range. The UI and debug overlay load a sidecar that matches their configured pixel height and fall back to TTF baking if it is absent, malformed, or sized differently. The audio system prefers an IMA sidecar and falls back to WAV, then converts samples to the playback device's format.

Run `zig build asset-build` to validate and stage the general asset set without installing the game. Use `audio` for uncompressed PCM WAV inputs that should also get an IMA ADPCM sidecar, or `wav` to keep only the WAV runtime file. Font rows include bake height, first codepoint, and glyph count after dependencies, for example `font font assets/font.ttf font.ttf - 10 32 224`. The build graph tracks the manifest, its source files, and the generated atlas input, so edits rebuild the asset step. Install Arm's `astcenc` command line tool and put it on `PATH` to generate ASTC variants; BC1, BC3, RGBA8, IMA ADPCM, and `.bfnt` outputs do not need extra tools.

The C code for text and widgets has its own tests in `tests/ui/`. They run from the project root and need a TrueType font, and `zig build test` doesn't run them:

```
zig cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Ivendor -Isrc/engine/ui tests/ui/test_imgui.c src/engine/ui/imgui.c src/engine/ui/text.c vendor/stb_truetype_impl.c -o test_imgui
./test_imgui path/to/font.ttf
zig cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Ivendor -Isrc/engine/ui tests/ui/test_text.c src/engine/ui/text.c vendor/stb_truetype_impl.c -o test_text
./test_text path/to/font.ttf
```

On Windows, name the outputs `test_imgui.exe` and `test_text.exe`, and run them as `.\test_imgui.exe` followed by the font path. A passing run prints `imgui: all checks passed` and `text: all checks passed`.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds and runs the unit tests on GitHub-hosted Linux, macOS, and Windows runners. It installs the Zig version declared by `build.zig.zon` and Slang 2026.20. The macOS job also builds with `-Dmetal=true` to compile the Metal shaders.

## Asset keyer

`tools/assets/keyer.c` replaces the old Windows-only `scripts/key_checker.ps1`. Build and run it on Windows, Linux, or macOS with Zig:

```sh
zig build asset-keyer -- assets/warrior.png assets/warrior_keyed.png
```

The tool finds the two most common near-gray colors in its brightness range, then makes matching pixels transparent only when they connect to the image border. This keeps similarly colored pixels enclosed by the artwork. It reads image formats supported by stb_image and writes PNG. Pass an output path explicitly to preserve the source image. Use `zig build asset-keyer -- --help` for tolerance and brightness options.

## Importing a sprite

Use the cross-platform importer to copy an image into the project and register it for the atlas:

```sh
zig build asset-import -- path/to/sprite.png my_sprite
zig build
```

The importer validates the image, preserves its file format, copies it to `assets/imported/`, and adds its name and path to `assets/sprites.txt`. The next build packs it into the runtime atlas automatically. Sprite names must start with a lowercase letter or digit and contain only lowercase letters, digits, `_`, or `-`; names must be unique. Keep the source artwork outside the project if you want an untouched copy. To remove an imported sprite, remove its row from `assets/sprites.txt` and delete its copied file. Run `zig build asset-import -- --help` for usage.

To remove a checkerboard before importing, run the keyer first and import its PNG output:

```sh
zig build asset-keyer -- path/to/sprite.png path/to/sprite_keyed.png
zig build asset-import -- path/to/sprite_keyed.png my_sprite
```

## Save and load

Press **F5** to save or **F9** to load. Saves are written to `save.json` beside the executable and use Parson to serialize a pretty, human-editable JSON document. The `save_version` field and component-scoped keys keep the format resilient: older files can omit newer component fields, while a save with a newer unsupported version is ignored and left untouched unless you explicitly save over it.

The file maps game state into component paths: `components.player.transform` stores position, `components.player.facing` stores direction, `components.player.animation` stores movement and elapsed time, `components.game.progress` stores clicks and volume, `components.world.level` identifies the map, and `components.display` stores scale mode and zoom. Invalid component values fall back to defaults; saved player positions outside the map or inside solid tiles are rejected.

For example:

```json
{
  "save_version": 1,
  "components": {
    "player": {
      "transform": { "x": 64, "y": 48 },
      "facing": { "direction": "down" },
      "animation": { "moving": false, "elapsed_seconds": 0 }
    },
    "game": { "progress": { "clicks": 3, "volume": 0.5 } },
    "world": { "level": { "id": "level1" } },
    "display": { "scale_mode": "fit", "zoom_target": 1 }
  }
}
```

## Debugging

Logs print to stderr, so `zig build run` shows them in the terminal, and they are also written to `Semkootru.log` beside the executable (see Log file below). Each terminal line has a timestamp, a level, and a scope:

```
[    1523ms] INFO  engine: window 960x540, native view 320x180, 60 update steps per second
```

Levels, from least to most severe, are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `err`. Debug builds show every level. Other builds show `info` and up. To change the threshold, assign to `engine.log.min_level`, a `pub var`, for example at the top of `main` in `main.zig`.

Assertions check invariants. A failed one prints the file and line, then panics with a stack trace. They run in Debug and ReleaseSafe builds and are compiled out in ReleaseFast and ReleaseSmall. Use `engine.log.assert(ok, @src(), "message {d}", .{value})` for a condition that should hold, and `engine.log.fail(@src(), "message", .{})` for code that should never run.

Every panic is also recorded in the log file before Zig prints it, so a failed assertion or a startup failure, such as a missing font, leaves its reason behind:

```
2026-10-29 07:57:18 ERROR panic: UI font 'assets/font.ttf' could not be read: FileNotFound
```

### Log file

`Semkootru.log` is written to the executable's folder, so after `zig build` it is `zig-out/bin/Semkootru.log`. Each line has a wall-clock time, a level, and a scope, and it holds the same messages as the terminal:

```
2026-10-29 07:57:18 INFO  game: atlas 512x512 with 2 sprites
```

The file is written by log.c (`vendor/log.c`), through `src/engine/log_file.c`. Each run replaces the file from the last run, so it holds one run only. Every line is flushed as it's written, so the file is complete even when the game crashes. Both outputs use the same level threshold. Change `log_file_name` in `game/config.zig` to rename the file, or set it to `null` to log to the terminal only. If the file can't be opened, the game warns in the terminal and keeps running.

### Profiling with Tracy

Profiling zones mark scopes in the frame. The engine marks each frame, and zones cover the event and update steps, the drawing passes, the sprite uploads, the GPU submit, and asset loading. Game code can add zones too. Zones compile to nothing unless the build uses `-Dtracy=true`, so a normal build has no profiler code. To profile:

1. Start the Tracy profiler, version 0.14.1, which matches the client that ztracy bundles.
2. Run `zig build run -Dtracy=true`. The log says `profiling zones on (Tracy)`.
3. Connect the profiler to `127.0.0.1`. Each frame appears as a frame mark, and the zones appear on the timeline.

To add a zone in game code, use `engine.profile`. A named zone reads best when one function has several zones:

```zig
const zone = engine.profile.zoneNamed(@src(), "draw enemies");
defer zone.End();
```

`engine.profile.zone(@src())` names the zone after its function. Put zones around passes and layers rather than inside per-sprite loops, because each zone has a cost.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Arrow keys, or W A S D | Move |
| Esc | Quit |
| F11 | Toggle fullscreen |
| F3 | Show or hide the debug overlay |
| I | Toggle integer scale |
| = or keypad + | Zoom in |
| - or keypad - | Zoom out |
| 0 | Reset zoom to 1× |
| Left mouse button | Presses the demo panel's button and drags its slider. |

Keys are bound to named actions in `game/controls.zig`. The defaults are in the table above, and `settings.txt` can rebind them.

### Settings file

The game reads `settings.txt` from beside the executable at startup. The project root has a copy with the defaults. Copy it into the folder with `Semkootru` (for example `zig-out/bin/`) to edit it. Changes apply the next time the game starts. A missing file means the defaults. The file holds `name = value` lines, and lines that start with `#` are comments.

| Setting | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `resolution` | `WIDTHxHEIGHT` in pixels, each from 64 to 8192 | `960x540` |
| `fullscreen` | `true` or `false` | `false` |
| `vsync` | `true` or `false`. Off presents frames as soon as they are ready, which can tear. | `true` |
| `bind <action> = <key>, ...` | Replaces the keys for one action, up to 4 keys. Key names are listed in `settings.txt`. | The keys in the table above |

With `fullscreen = true` the window uses the monitor's own mode, so `resolution` applies when the window is windowed. F11 still toggles fullscreen during play. A bad value or an unknown name is written to the log and the default is kept.

## How it works

### Rendering model

The world is drawn at native resolution into an offscreen target, and that target is then stretched to fill the window.

```
world tiles + player ──► pass 1: sprite batch ──► native target (view_w x view_h)
                                                        │
                                pass 2: stretch quad    ▼
                                                  swapchain (window pixels)
```

At zoom 1 the native view is never smaller than 320x180 pixels. The window's aspect ratio decides which axis fits exactly: on the limiting axis the view is exactly 320 or 180 pixels, and the other axis shows more of the world. In fit mode the window therefore never has black bars. At the default 960x540 window the scale is exactly 3x, which is the cleanest case for pixel art. Other sizes give fractional scales, so some native pixels cover three screen pixels and others cover four. The default fit mode accepts that trade-off. Integer mode uses a whole-number multiple of the view size, so every native pixel is the same size. The result is centered, and thin black bars fill any leftover space at the edges. Set `scale_mode` in `game/config.zig`, or press I to toggle it. Integer mode needs a window at least as large as one native view. Below that, it falls back to fit.

Zoom multiplies the scale, and the view size follows from it. At zoom 2 the scale doubles and the view is half as large, so each world pixel is twice as big. At zoom 0.5 the view is twice as large. The camera, culling, and mouse mapping all read the view size, so they work at any zoom. In integer mode the zoomed scale is rounded to a whole number, never below 1, so every native pixel is still the same size.

### Frame lifecycle

The loop is in `engine/engine.zig`. Game logic runs at a fixed rate, and drawing runs once per frame.

1. Measure the frame time since the last frame, capped at 0.1 s.
2. Drain the SDL event queue. The engine handles quit requests, F11, and F3. Key and mouse events update the held state, and presses, releases, and clicks wait in `Input` for the next update step.
3. Add the frame time to an accumulator. While it holds at least one fixed step (1/60 s by default), latch the pending input so it reaches exactly one update, run game `update` with `ctx.dt` set to that step, and subtract the step. Stop early if the game sets `running` to false.
4. Game `update`: read actions from `game/controls.zig`. Quit, scale toggle, and zoom act on their press. Movement actions move the player at 80 px/s, with diagonals normalized, and solid tiles stop the player's feet on each axis, so the player slides along walls.
5. Compute `alpha`, the leftover fraction of a step, from 0 to 1. Drawing blends between the last two updates with it, so motion stays smooth when the display rate and update rate differ.
6. Read the window size in pixels. If either side is zero, the window is minimized, so sleep for 16 ms (`idle_sleep_ms` in `engine/engine.zig`) and start the next frame. Otherwise, ease the camera's zoom toward the zoom the game asked for, choose the scale for the current scale mode and zoom (see Rendering model), then compute the view size. The reference native view is 320×180 in `game/config.zig`.
7. If the view size changed, wait for the GPU to go idle and recreate the native target.
8. Acquire a command buffer and swapchain texture. If either is unavailable, sleep for the same 16 ms and start the next frame, so a minimized window doesn't spin.
9. Pass 1: game `draw` points the camera at the player's blended center and queues the visible tiles and the player. The engine uploads the vertices and draws them into the native target. The debug overlay is queued after the game, in the same pass.
10. Pass 2: queue one quad that stretches the native target across the window. In fit mode it covers the whole window. In integer mode it covers a centered whole-number multiple of the view.
11. Submit the command buffer.

### Coordinate systems

- **World space** is in native pixels, with the origin at the map's top-left corner and y increasing downward. Tiles are 16 px.
- **Camera** `x` and `y` give the world position of the view's top-left corner. They keep fractions while the camera eases. Each sprite and tile rounds its screen position once, with `Camera.screenX` and `screenY`, so everything stays on whole pixels without the camera stepping on its own.
- **Sprite destinations** are in view pixels, so world positions have the camera subtracted. `SpriteBatch` multiplies them by the projection from `math.ortho2d`, which gives normalized device coordinates with y pointing up.
- **Sprite sources** are in texels. `drawSprite` converts them to 0 to 1 UV coordinates.
- **Tint** is an RGB multiplier, and **alpha** is a separate per-sprite multiplier. Both are set through `drawSprite`'s options.
- **Zoom** changes the view size, not the world units. At zoom 2 the view covers half as many world pixels, so the camera, culling, and mouse mapping need no zoom-specific code.
- **Mouse** positions from SDL are in window points. `Context.mouseWorld` converts them to world pixels, using the layout and camera of the last frame drawn.
- **UI** positions are in view pixels, from the top-left corner of the view. The camera doesn't move them. The UI maps the pointer with `view.windowToView`, not `Context.mouseWorld`, so the panel stays put while the camera moves.

## Progress

### Implemented

**Platform and application**
- SDL3 initialization and a resizable, high-DPI window that starts at 960x540 unless `settings.txt` says otherwise.
- Quit on window close or Esc. F11 toggles fullscreen.
- Fixed-timestep update loop (60 steps per second by default) with an accumulator. Frame time is capped at 0.1 s, and `draw` gets an interpolation factor.
- Live stats in an on-screen debug overlay with a frame-time graph, toggled with F3. The window title is no longer used for stats.
- A minimized window idles instead of spinning the CPU.
- Profiling zones through Tracy (`-Dtracy=true`), which compile to nothing otherwise, and a log file beside the executable, written through log.c. Panics are recorded in the log file.

**GPU and shaders**
- GPU device creation with a Vulkan 1.2 request, SPIR-V shaders (plus DXIL when built with `-Ddxil=true`), and an optional validation layer (`-Dgpu-debug`).
- Swapchain claim, command buffer acquire and submit, and clear-color render passes.
- A build step that compiles two Slang entry points to SPIR-V, and to DXIL when `-Ddxil=true` is set, and embeds them in the executable.
- Shader loading that picks the first format the device accepts (SPIR-V first, then DXIL). Shader code is embedded in the executable at build time, aligned for 32-bit word reads, and each shader's entry point and resource counts are declared as a `shader.Source` beside the pipeline in `sprite.zig`.
- One sprite shader: the texture sample multiplied by the vertex color.

**Textures and images**
- PNG decoding through stb_image, converted to RGBA8.
- Texture upload through a transfer buffer, queued without waiting for the GPU.
- Render-target textures in the swapchain format.
- Nearest-neighbor sampler with clamp-to-edge addressing.
- Assets installed beside the executable and loaded through `SDL_GetBasePath`, so the game runs from any directory.
- Build-time texture atlas: `tools/atlas/pack.c` packs the sprites listed in `assets/sprites.txt` into one square PNG with stb_rect_pack. The square is the smallest power of two that fits, and each sprite has one transparent texel of padding on every side. `engine/atlas.zig` reads the index written beside the image, and the game draws every sprite from that one texture.

**2D rendering**
- Sprite batching: quads buffered per frame as four vertices drawn through an index buffer, one draw call per run of the same texture, alpha blending, tint, source rectangles, and no fixed sprite or texture-switch limit.
- Per-sprite options through `drawSprite`: flip, rotation around an origin, alpha, and z-order. Sprites are sorted by z once per frame, and sprites with equal z keep the order they were added in.
- Tile world rendering with view culling and a one-tile margin.
- Camera follow with frame-rate-independent smoothing, edge clamping, pixel snapping, and centering when the world is smaller than the view.
- Camera zoom from keys. Each press multiplies or divides the zoom by 1.25, and the camera eases to the new zoom in logarithmic steps. Zoom changes the view size, so the camera, culling, and mouse mapping work unchanged. Integer mode rounds the zoomed scale to a whole number.
- The two-pass pixel-art pipeline: native target, then stretch to the window.
- Fit and integer scale modes, set in `game/config.zig` or toggled with I.

**Text and UI**
- TTF fonts are preprocessed at build time with stb_truetype into compact `.bfnt` sidecars containing the alpha glyph atlas, metrics, and codepoint range. Runtime loading expands the atlas to RGBA for GPU upload and falls back to TTF baking if a sidecar is unavailable or incompatible. The atlas starts at 128 pixels and doubles until every glyph fits.
- Text becomes one quad per glyph, decoded from UTF-8. Codepoints outside the baked range (32 to 255) draw as `?`.
- Immediate-mode widgets in `src/engine/ui/imgui.c`: label, button, and slider. Hover and press are tracked through two ids, and a `##` suffix tells duplicate labels apart without drawing the suffix.
- `src/engine/ui.zig` uploads the font and queues the UI quads as sprites at z 1000, so they draw above the world.
- Input tracks the left button's held state, and its press and release each reach one update step.
- A demo panel in `game/game.zig` (a label, a click counter, and a volume slider) runs in the update step, as a first end-to-end check of the text and widget path.

**Math and data**
- cglm for vectors and matrices, wrapped in `math.zig`. The sprite projection and diagonal normalization use it. `math.zig` also covers 3D transforms, perspective and look-at matrices, and quaternions (slerp, look rotation, billboard). Only the 2D parts are used so far.
- Validated names and paths (`string.zig`), a hash map keyed by names (`hash_map.zig`), and an asset table that gives each name a dense id (`assets.zig`).
- Tile maps (`tilemap.zig`): a text format with three layers (ground, decoration, foreground), tile IDs, empty cells written as `.`, solid IDs, and a spawn cell. Malformed maps report what is wrong. `TileMap.moveBox` moves a box against solid tiles, one axis at a time.
- Sprite-sheet animation (`animation.zig`): clips that name a row of frames, with frame time and loop mode, and an animator per entity.
- `zig build test` runs every unit test: the string, hash map, asset table, math, view, tile map, camera, animation, input, and renderer modules. It links SDL and opens no window or GPU device.
- Mouse mapping from window points to view and world pixels in `view.zig`, through `Context.mouseWorld`. Its tests run with `zig build test`.

**Gameplay**
- Player movement with arrow keys or WASD, normalized diagonals, and collision with solid tiles.
- A 16×32 South Indian warrior sprite loaded from `assets/warrior_16x32.png`, with separate player width and height constants.
- Directional sprite selection for front/down, right, back/up, and left; horizontal input wins when moving diagonally.
- Walk clips with frame 0 shown while idle; the back-facing row cycles through four frames. Changing clip restarts it at its first frame.

**Tooling**
- `-Dgpu-debug`, `-Ddxil`, and `-Dtracy` build options.
- `tools/assets/keyer.c` replaces the old PowerShell checkerboard-removal script. The current warrior runtime sheet is `assets/warrior_16x32.png`; the keyer requires separate input and output paths, so it leaves the source artwork in place.

### Module status

These estimates are rough. They measure how close each area is to something usable for a small 2D game, not how much code it has.

| Area | File | Status | Est. done | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Platform | `sdl.zig` | Complete | 100% | Single C-import point for SDL3. |
| Engine | `engine/engine.zig` | Prototype | 65% | Window, GPU setup, native-view pipeline, fixed-timestep loop, fit and integer scaling, camera zoom, and the `Game` interface. Missing: scene or state system, device-lost recovery. |
| Logging and assertions | `engine/log.zig`, `log_file.c`, `vendor/log.c` | Functional | 85% | Levels, scopes, timestamps, and assertions that check in Debug and ReleaseSafe. Terminal and log file output through log.c, with panics recorded in the file. Missing: rotation, and keeping logs from earlier runs. |
| Profiling | `profile.zig`, `engine/engine.zig` | Functional | 60% | Tracy zones for the frame, events, updates, passes, uploads, submit, and asset loads, plus frame marks. Compiled in only with `-Dtracy=true`. A captured session checked the zone names and counts. Missing: GPU timing zones, allocation tracking, and plots. |
| Gameplay | `game/` | Prototype | 20% | Player with directional walk clips, one level loaded from `assets/maps/level1.txt` and drawn in layers, and movement and quit actions bound in `game/controls.zig`. No entities or rules. |
| Renderer | `renderer.zig` | Solid base | 75% | Device, swapchain, and passes work. Asks the device for DXIL and MSL only when the build embeds those formats. Pass settings are unit tested. Device and frame calls need a GPU and aren't. Missing: device-lost recovery, pass helpers. |
| Shaders | `shader.zig` | Basic | 65% | Picks the first shader format the device accepts (SPIR-V, DXIL, then MSL) and creates GPU shaders from code embedded at build time. DXIL (`-Ddxil=true`) and MSL (`-Dmetal=true`) are optional. Per-shader entry points and resource counts are declared in `sprite.zig`. Missing: reflection. Uniform buffer count is supported but unused. |
| Textures | `texture.zig` | Solid base | 70% | Uploads queue without waiting, and `isReady` reports when one finishes. Missing: unload and reload. |
| Atlas | `atlas.zig`, `tools/atlas/pack.c` | Functional | 60% | Build-time packing with stb_rect_pack, index parsing with validation, and lookup by name. Missing: runtime packing, several atlas pages, rotated sprites. |
| Images | `image.zig` | Basic | 60% | PNG and other formats through stb_image to RGBA8. Synchronous, relative paths only. |
| Math | `math.zig` | Functional | 60% | cglm wrappers: identity, mul, invert, transpose, translate, scale, rotate, ortho, perspective, look-at, point and vector transforms, 3D vector helpers, and quaternions (slerp, look rotation, billboard). 18 tests. Only the 2D parts are used so far. |
| Strings | `string.zig` | Functional | 70% | Validated `Name` (up to 64 bytes) and `Path` (up to 255 bytes, null-terminated). Rules are in the file's doc comments. |
| Hash map | `hash_map.zig` | Functional | 70% | Open addressing with full key comparison, growth at 3/4 load, removal by backward-shift deletion (no tombstones), checked against `std.StringHashMap`. |
| Assets | `assets.zig` | Early | 40% | Names, dense ids, and validated paths. The game no longer uses it, since its sprites come from the atlas. Loading and caching are in `asset_cache.zig`, which looks assets up by these names. |
| Asset cache | `asset_cache.zig` | Early | 50% | Generic cache keyed by asset name: reference counts, load on first `acquire`, and `unloadUnused`. Names and paths come from `assets.zig`, and the index is the engine's `StringMap`. Not yet compiled or run, and not yet used by the engine or game. Missing: GPU textures through the cache, unloading on a schedule, hot reload. |
| Sprites | `sprite.zig` | Functional | 75% | Batched quads with four vertices each and a 32-bit index buffer. Per-sprite tint, alpha, flip, rotation around an origin, and z-order, sorted once per frame. Storage grows with each frame. Missing: instancing. |
| Camera | `camera.zig` | Functional | 75% | Follow, frame-rate-independent smoothing, clamp, per-sprite pixel rounding, and eased zoom. Missing: dead zone, shake. |
| Animation | `animation.zig` | Functional | 60% | Clips with a row, frame count, frame time, and loop mode, plus an `Animator` per entity that restarts only when its clip changes. Missing: blending between clips, animation events. |
| Level | `game/level.zig` | Early | 50% | Tile map drawn one layer at a time with culling, in ground, decoration, player, foreground order. Solid tiles block the player. No tile animation. |
| Tile map | `engine/tilemap.zig` | Functional | 70% | Text map format with clear parse errors, three layers, empty cells, solid IDs on any layer, a spawn cell, and box movement that stops at solid tiles, one axis at a time. Missing: Tiled import. |
| Input | `input.zig` | Functional | 60% | Held, pressed, and released keys work through the `Key` enum, and one-shot input reaches exactly one update step. The left button's held, pressed, and released state is tracked for the UI. Clicks don't store a position yet. `mouse_x` and `mouse_y` are window points; use `Context.mouseWorld` for world coordinates. No gamepad or text input. Unit tests are in `src/tests.zig`. |
| View mapping | `view.zig` | Functional | 70% | Fits the native view to the window for each zoom and scale mode (`chooseFit`). Converts mouse positions from window points to view and world pixels, using the rectangle the view is drawn into. Pure math with its own tests, run by `zig build test`. |
| Build | `build.zig`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Functional | 70% | Builds SDL3, stb_image, stb_truetype, cglm, the UI C sources, embedded shaders (SPIR-V, optional DXIL and MSL), the texture atlas, the asset keyer, run step, and test step. CI builds and tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows. |
| Assets | `tools/assets/keyer.c` | Utility | 30% | Cross-platform checkerboard keyer with configurable color thresholds, connected-border flood fill, and PNG output. It replaces the old one-off PowerShell script; it is not a general asset pipeline. |
| Tests | `src/tests.zig` | Functional | 50% | Every unit test, run by `zig build test`: string, hash map, assets, compressed texture headers, IMA ADPCM decoding, math, view, tile map, camera, animation, input, shader format selection, and renderer. The C tests for text and widgets are in `tests/ui/` and run separately (see Building and running). Missing: tests that open a window or create a GPU device. |
| Vector | `vector.zig` | Functional | 60% | Generic struct vector in AoS or SoA, one allocation for either layout, strided column views that work under both, and contiguous `items` under SoA. Missing: shrinking, sorting, and removal of unused capacity. |
| Entities | `entity.zig` | Functional | 45% | World of component rows with generational handles, dense rows, and swap-remove despawn that repairs the handle of a moved row. The player is still a struct in `game/player.zig`, so no game code uses the world yet. Missing: spawning from level data, queries, and component tags. |
| Debug overlay | `debug_overlay.zig`, `frame_history.zig` | Early | 40% | Frame-time graph and frame stats drawn in the native view, toggled with F3. Replaces the title stats. The frame history is unit tested. The overlay has not yet been checked in the running game. Missing: CPU split of update, draw, and present time, and a record of past spikes. |
| Collision | none | Not started | 0% | |
| Audio | `audio.zig`, `audio_voices.zig`, `ima.zig` | Early | 45% | One default playback device, WAV input plus build-generated IMA ADPCM sidecars, device-format conversion at load, and voices that each use one SDL audio stream, which SDL mixes. Decoder and voice rules have unit tests. The game plays no sounds yet. Missing: streaming long music from disk, positional audio, volume categories, reacting to device changes. |
| Text | `ui/text.c`, `ui/text.h`, `ui.zig` | Early | 45% | Build-time TTF preprocessing into versioned `.bfnt` sidecars with glyph atlas, metrics, and codepoint range; runtime falls back to TTF baking when needed. One quad per glyph, UTF-8 input. The C harness covers preprocessing round-trip and malformed sidecars. Missing: kerning, shaping for Tamil and other complex scripts, hinting, and manifest-configurable ranges beyond the current 32 to 255. |
| UI widgets | `ui/imgui.c`, `ui/imgui.h` | Early | 35% | Label, button, and slider with hot and active ids and `##` suffixes. Tested with the C harness using scripted input. Not yet checked in the running game. Missing: checkbox, panels and layouts beyond one column, text input, keyboard focus, scrolling. |
| Scenes and state | none | Not started | 0% | |

## Building on what exists

These are the natural extension points. Each one reuses existing code.

**Character sprite and animation.** The warrior is a region of the texture atlas, found by name at startup, and drawn through the existing `drawSprite` source-rectangle API, offset by that region. Each cell is 16×32 pixels. `game/player.zig` keeps a facing and an `engine.animation.Animator`. Each update, `clipFor` picks the clip for the facing and whether the player is moving, and the animator restarts only when the clip changes. The back-facing row uses four frames, while the other rows use five, and the clip for standing still shows frame 0. To add an animation, define a `Clip` (sheet row, frame count, frame time, loop mode) and select it in `clipFor`.

**Add a tile layer.** Layers are the `Layer` enum in `engine/tilemap.zig`, and `all_layers` lists them. To add one, add an enum value and its name to `parseLayer`, then call `Level.drawLayer` for it in `Game.draw` at the point in the draw order where it belongs. A solid ID on any layer blocks movement.

**Add collision to an entity.** Give the entity a `tilemap.Box` and call `TileMap.moveBox` with its movement each update, the same way `Player.update` does. Map edges count as solid, so they act as walls.

**Add camera effects.** The camera is a position and a view size. `followSmooth` eases toward the clamped target, and `camera_rate` in `game/config.zig` sets how fast. Shake is an offset applied after `follow`. Zoom is already in place: `Context.zoomBy` and `resetZoom` set the target, `engine/engine.zig` eases `Camera.zoom` toward it each frame, and `view.chooseFit` turns the zoom into a scale and a view size. Drawing and culling read the view size, so they need no changes. To change the limits or the step, edit `zoom_min`, `zoom_max`, `zoom_step`, and `zoom_rate` in `game/config.zig`.

**Add input actions.** Add a name to `Action` in `game/controls.zig`, give it default keys in `defaultKeys`, and query it with `self.bindings.held`, `self.bindings.pressed`, or `self.bindings.released`. The settings file can then bind it with a `bind` line. Gameplay never checks a key directly. To use a key the engine doesn't know yet, add it to `Key` in `engine/input.zig` and map it to its SDL scancode. A new key name works in `bind` lines as soon as it is in `Key`.

**Add a shader or pipeline.** Add the entry point to `shaders/default.slang`, because `build.zig` compiles only that file (to compile another file, give `ShaderEntry` a source path). Add a row for each entry point to `shader_entries` in `build.zig`, and declare a `shader.Source` in `sprite.zig` with the stage, resource counts, and embedded code for each format. DXIL and MSL slices are empty unless enabled with `-Ddxil=true` or `-Dmetal=true`. Follow the target-specific resource declarations in `default.slang`; Slang emits Metal texture and sampler arguments for MSL. Load it with `shader.load` and create a pipeline the way `SpriteBatch.init` does. Pipelines are built for a specific shader pair and color format, so a second one needs its own init.

**Add a render target.** `Texture.initTarget` creates a target in the swapchain format. Pass it to `Renderer.beginPass` to draw into it, then sample it like any other texture. Use this for lighting, post-processing, or a minimap.

**Add a sprite.** Run `zig build asset-import -- path/to/image.png sprite_name`. This copies the image to `assets/imported/` and registers it in `assets/sprites.txt`; the next `zig build` packs it into the atlas. In the game, look the sprite up once with `Game.atlas_index.find(name)` and keep the returned region. Draw it by offsetting the source rectangle by the region's position in the atlas, as `Level.drawLayer` and `Player.draw` do.

**Add entities.** Define the components as one struct with a field per component value, for example `const Body = struct { x: f32, vx: f32, id: u64 };`. Create a world with `var world = engine.entity.World(Body, .soa).init(allocator)`, choosing `.aos` or `.soa` as the layout (see `engine/vector.zig`). Spawn with `world.spawn(row)`, which returns a `Handle`. Keep the handle, not a row index, because despawning moves rows. A system loops over `0..world.count()` and reads a field with `world.rows.column("vx")`, which works the same under either layout. Under SoA, `world.rows.items("x")` gives a plain slice when a system needs one. Draw entities as `Player.draw` does, subtracting the camera from world positions.

**Add a UI widget or panel.** Widgets are in `src/engine/ui/imgui.c`. A widget takes the next row of its column with `next_row`, calls `interact` to track hover and press, then appends quads with `fill` or `ui_font_draw_text`. The demo panel in `game/game.zig` shows the pattern: `updateUi` builds the widgets in the update step, so each press is seen once, and `draw` passes the quads to `engine.ui.queueQuads`. To change the font, replace `assets/font.ttf`, or edit `ui_font_path` and `ui_font_px` in `game/config.zig`.

## Known issues

1. **Fixed: mouse coordinates were in window points, not world pixels.** `Context.mouseWorld` converts the mouse position from points to pixels, maps it through the rectangle the view was drawn into (which covers the scale, centering, and rounding), and adds the camera position. Both the layout and the camera come from the last frame drawn, so an update sees what the player saw. Clicks don't store a position yet, so a click handler reads the cursor's last known position.

2. **Fixed: asset paths depended on the working directory.** The build installs `assets/` beside the executable, and `Context.loadTexture` resolves paths against the executable's folder from `SDL_GetBasePath`. Shaders are embedded at build time, so nothing else depends on the working directory.

3. **Fixed: a minimized window spun the CPU.** A zero-size window, or a frame with no swapchain, used to restart the loop without waiting. Both cases now sleep for 16 ms first, so a minimized window idles.

4. **Vulkan is the default backend. Direct3D 12 and Metal formats are opt-in.** SPIR-V shaders are always built. `zig build -Ddxil=true` embeds DXIL (`sm_6_0`), and `zig build -Dmetal=true` embeds MSL; the renderer tells SDL which optional formats are available. `shader.pickFormat` selects the first supported format. SDL consumes Slang's MSL source with the original entry-point names. The `default.slang` sampler declarations cover Vulkan and D3D12; Slang maps the texture and sampler to Metal arguments for MSL. Vertex locations match the attributes in `sprite.zig`.

5. **Fixed: names didn't match.** The package is `Bairava` in `build.zig.zon`, the executable and window are `Semkootru`, and the sprite shader is `default.slang`.

6. **`root.zig` is template code.** Its functions and test are not used by the game, and `zig build test` runs `src/tests.zig`, which doesn't import it. Delete the file or move real tests into it.

7. **Fixed: texture uploads blocked.** `Texture.initRgba8` used to wait for the GPU to go idle. It now queues the copy and returns. `Texture.isReady` reports when the copy finishes, and `SpriteBatch.draw` skips a texture until then, so a texture can be loaded at any time.

8. **Fixed: sprite batches had hard limits.** `SpriteBatch` used to panic above 8192 sprites or 256 texture switches in one frame. Its vertex storage, batch list, and GPU buffers now double when they fill. The one ceiling left is SDL's 32-bit buffer size, about 33 million sprites in one frame.

9. **Fixed: the package file list omitted build inputs.** `.paths` in `build.zig.zon` now includes `shaders` and `vendor`, which the build needs. `assets` stays out, since the build doesn't read it.

10. **Fixed: the SPIR-V version was not pinned.** `build.zig` now passes `-profile spirv_1_5` to `slangc`, the version that matches the Vulkan 1.2 request made at runtime.

11. **Fixed: `view.zig`'s tests didn't run.** `src/tests.zig` imports `view.zig`, so its five tests run with `zig build test`.

12. **Zoom recreates the native target.** A zoom step that changes the view size rebuilds the native target and waits for the GPU to go idle, as a window resize does. Zoom eases over a fraction of a second, so one zoom can cause several rebuilds. The target is small, so this should be cheap, but it has not been measured. In fit mode a fractional zoom leaves some native pixels one screen pixel larger than others, as fit mode already does. Integer mode rounds zoom to whole scales, so its steps are coarser than fit mode's, and at a base scale of 1 it cannot zoom out at all.

13. **Fonts must be TrueType, and the baked text range is fixed.** `ui_font_bake` reads TrueType outlines through stb_truetype. A CFF-based `.otf` font fails to bake, and the game panics at startup with "could not be baked". The text covers codepoints 32 to 255 at one pixel height, with no kerning, hinting, or shaping, so Tamil and other complex scripts won't render correctly.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: finish the vertical slice

- [x] Draw the warrior from `assets/warrior_16x32.png` with 16×32 source frames and directional walk animation.
- [x] Fix one-shot input and add press and release detection.
- [x] Map keys to named actions.
- [x] Move the player and game state out of `main.zig`.
- [x] Separate fixed-timestep updates from rendering.
- [x] Add an integer-scale option for pixel-perfect output.

### Phase 2: a playable map

- [x] Store tile IDs per cell and per layer, loaded from a simple custom text format. Importing Tiled exports is not started.
- [x] Tile collision with axis-separated movement.
- [x] Multiple layers: ground, decoration, and foreground. The player is drawn between decoration and foreground.
- [x] Camera zoom. Eased, bounded by `zoom_min` and `zoom_max`, and bound to keys.
- [x] Advanced animation state and per-entity animation data. Clips and an animator per entity are done. Blending between clips and animation events are not.

### Phase 3: engine infrastructure

- [x] Texture atlas with packing at build time.
- [x] Index buffer for quads (4 vertices instead of 6). The vertex and index buffers grow together.
- [x] Sprite flip, rotation, origin, per-sprite alpha, and z-order, passed as `drawSprite` options.
- [x] Entity system: AoS and SoA vectors under a handle-based world. The player is not migrated yet.
- [ ] Asset manager with caching. Executable-relative paths already work. The cache module exists in `asset_cache.zig`, but the game doesn't load its textures through it yet.
- [x] Asynchronous texture uploads.
- [x] Shader embedding at build time.
- [x] Audio through SDL3 audio streams, with PCM WAV support and optional build-encoded IMA ADPCM sidecars. The demo game doesn't play sounds yet.
- [ ] Text rendering and basic UI widgets.
- [ ] On-screen debug overlay with a frame-time graph, replacing the title stats.
- [x] Profiling zones (for example Tracy), and log file output.
- [x] Settings file for resolution, fullscreen, vsync, and key bindings.
- [x] Unit tests wired into `zig build test`.

### Phase 4: platforms and tooling

- [x] Compile shaders to DXIL (Direct3D 12) alongside SPIR-V, opt-in with `-Ddxil=true`, and enable that device format.
- [x] Compile shaders to MSL (Metal) and enable that device format, opt-in with `-Dmetal=true`.
- [x] Linux and macOS native build coverage and continuous integration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (the workflow also covers Windows).
- [x] Cross-platform checkerboard keyer replacing `key_checker.ps1` (`tools/assets/keyer.c`, `zig build asset-keyer`).
- [x] Sprite import workflow (`zig build asset-import`): validate, copy, and register an image for the atlas. It preserves the source format and does not transcode or compress assets.
- [ ] Level editor and Tiled map import.
- [x] Save and load with versioned Parson JSON; F5 saves and F9 loads.

### Phase 5: build-time content pipeline

MonoGame's MGCB is a useful comparison for the missing layer: it processes source content into runtime-ready assets. Bairava already compiles shaders, packs sprites into an atlas, and has a sprite importer, but these are separate tools. The importer copies and registers an image; it does not create platform-optimized texture or audio files. At runtime, images are decoded to RGBA8 and audio is loaded from WAV and converted to the active device format.

The engine is currently a 2D project, so prioritize textures, audio, and fonts rather than 3D model conversion. Keep source assets editable, and make generated outputs reproducible from a content manifest and selected build target.

- [ ] Add a general, manifest-driven asset build step that validates source assets, tracks dependencies, and emits runtime-ready outputs with a generated asset index.
- [ ] Transcode and compress textures for supported GPU formats, including BC1/BC3 and ASTC where available. Keep an RGBA8 fallback and select an output the active SDL GPU device can load.
- [ ] Convert or encode source audio into smaller runtime assets and load those formats through the audio system; retain WAV input for simple or uncompressed assets.
- [x] Move font processing toward build-time outputs and metadata so runtime loading can use preprocessed font assets where appropriate.
- [x] Defer 3D model processing until the engine has a 3D rendering path and model-based content to support.

### Phase 6: native and vector font processing

- [ ] Extend SpriteFont processing and text rendering to support TTF/OTF inputs, including CFF outlines, configurable packed glyph atlases, dynamic glyph rasterization and caching, kerning, and SDF rendering for scalable text.

## Conventions

- Units: world, camera, and sprite positions are in native pixels, and time is `f32` seconds.
- Game `update` runs at the fixed rate `update_hz` in `game/config.zig`, and `ctx.dt` is that step. `draw` runs once per frame and gets `alpha`, which blends between the last two updates.
- Asset paths are relative to the executable's folder. The build installs `assets/` to `zig-out/bin/assets/`, along with the packed `atlas.png` and `atlas.txt`, so a path such as `assets/atlas.png` works from any directory.
- `assets/warrior.png` is the original source art; the build packs the prepared 80×128 `assets/warrior_16x32.png` sheet into the atlas instead.
- Only `sdl.zig` imports SDL's C headers, only `math.zig` imports cglm's, and only `profile.zig` imports ztracy.
- The C code for text and widgets lives in `src/engine/ui/` and never touches SDL or the GPU. Only `text.c` and `vendor/stb_truetype_impl.c` include `stb_truetype.h`. `ui.zig` is the one bridge from that code to the sprite batch.
- `math.zig`, `string.zig`, `hash_map.zig`, `assets.zig`, `asset_cache.zig`, `atlas.zig`, `vector.zig`, `entity.zig`, `view.zig`, `tilemap.zig`, `camera.zig`, `animation.zig`, and `audio_voices.zig` don't import SDL or `log.zig`, so they can be tested without a GPU. Keep new pure code the same way when you can, and list its file in `src/tests.zig`. Modules that import SDL are listed there too, and their tests call no SDL function that needs a window or GPU.
- Asset names and paths are validated once, when they're registered, and nothing downstream checks them again.
- Engine code lives in `src/engine/` and never names a game type. Game code lives in `src/game/` and uses the engine only through `engine/engine.zig`.
- Initialization failures and shader or GPU setup errors panic with the SDL message. Image loading returns Zig errors.
- Capacity limits are constants that panic when exceeded, so overflows are caught early.
- Log with `engine.log.scoped`, and check invariants with `engine.log.assert`. Don't use `std.debug.assert`, which is undefined behavior in release builds.
- GPU objects are released by their `deinit`. Resources in the engine loop and in the game's `deinit` are released with `defer`, in reverse order of creation.
- Comments explain why. Public items have doc comments.
