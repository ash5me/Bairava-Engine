//! The engine's public API. Game code imports only this file: everything the game may use is
//! re-exported here, so the modules under src/engine/ can move without changing game code.
//!
//! Engine code never names a game type. A game plugs in by passing a type with `init`, `update`,
<<<<<<< HEAD
//! `draw`, and `deinit` to `run`. `init` runs once; then `update` and `draw` repeat until shutdown;
//! after successful initialization, `deinit` runs once. The game owns resources it loads and must
//! release them in `deinit` before the engine tears down the GPU and platform. Game `init` may
//! return a recoverable error; the runtime logs it and unwinds the session without entering the
//! frame loop. Truly fatal programmer errors and broken invariants still panic.
=======
//! `draw`, and `deinit` to `run`.
>>>>>>> main
//!
//! Timing: `update` runs at a fixed rate, so game logic doesn't depend on the display. `draw`
//! runs once per frame and gets `alpha` to blend between the last two updates.
