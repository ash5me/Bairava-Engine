//! The scene contract. A scene is a struct with four methods:
//!
//!     pub fn init(ctx: *Ctx) !Self
//!     pub fn update(self: *Self, ctx: *Ctx, nav: *Navigator) void
//!     pub fn draw(self: *Self, dc: *const DrawCtx) void
//!     pub fn deinit(self: *Self) void
//!
//! `Ctx` and `DrawCtx` are the engine's context types, and `nav` is the handle a scene uses to change the stack: `nav.switchTo(T)` replaces
//! the scene, `nav.push(T)` opens a child above it, and `nav.pop()` closes it (see scene_manager.zig). `init` runs once, before the first update, and
//! `deinit` runs once after a successful `init`, when the scene is popped, replaced, or the manager shuts
//! down. A scene must not keep `ctx`, `dc`, or `nav` after the call that received them.

/// Fails the build, naming the scene and the method, when `T` lacks one of the four methods or one
/// of them takes the wrong number of parameters. The parameter types are checked where the scene
/// is used, so a mismatched type fails there with the compiler's own message.
